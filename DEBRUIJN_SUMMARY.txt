DE BRUIJN GRAPH COMPLETION SUMMARY
================================================================================

Task Completed: ✓ Successfully filled in missing information in De Bruijn graph

Files Created/Updated:
----------------------
1. debruijn_graph_complete.xlsx - Updated original file with all 425 kmers
   - 70 nodes (contigs) have complete information
   - 354 kmers are intermediate (part of merged nodes)

2. debruijn_graph_nodes_only.xlsx - Clean version with only the 70 graph nodes
   - Easier to view and understand the graph structure
   - Shows only the start kmer of each contig with full information

3. debruijn_graph_complete_backup.xlsx - Backup of original file

Graph Statistics:
-----------------
- Total unique kmers: 425
- Total graph nodes (contigs): 70
- Nodes numbered: 0-69

- End nodes (no outgoing edges): 16
- Branch points (multiple outgoing): 14
- Merge points (multiple incoming): 7

Structure Verification:
-----------------------
✓ All node numbers assigned correctly
✓ All incoming edges verified against contig graph
✓ All outgoing edges verified against contig graph
✓ All merged node sequences match contig sequences
✓ No duplicate node numbers found

How the Graph Works:
--------------------
Each node represents a "contig" - an unbranched path through the De Bruijn graph:
  - The "kmers" column shows the starting 5-mer suffix of the contig
  - The "merged_node" column shows the full sequence formed by this contig
  - The "incoming_edge" shows which nodes connect TO this node
  - The "outgoing_edge" shows which nodes this node connects TO

Example from the graph:
- Node 0 (aboveimonly): Receives from node 15, goes to nodes 57,58
- Node 1 (afterall): Receives from node 9, goes to nodes 43,44,45
- This creates a network representing the song lyrics "Only Human"

Based on Example Format:
------------------------
The format matches the hw8_example11.pdf showing the Hamlet quote example:
- Each row represents a potential starting point for a contig
- Branch points occur when one node has multiple outgoing connections
- Merge points occur when multiple nodes feed into one node
- Cycles appear when a path loops back to an earlier node
